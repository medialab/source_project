States that have become members of the European Union after 1999 have also become members of Schengen. Schengen today applies to 26 States, 4 of which are non-EU members. It has expanded far beyond the five founding members, which do not have the monopoly over Schengen.",

The years 1984-85 accelerate this community-based history of free movement. Art. 8a TEC, created by the Single European Act, makes provision for the abolition of internal borders by 1992. This would result in the unification of the territory of the Member States, attributing a more significant role to community actors.",
